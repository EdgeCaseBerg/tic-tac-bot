## Tic Tak Bot

This is a discord bot that will facilitate a game of Tic Tac Toe between 
users in a discord server. 

Create a token.txt file and place it next to the executable, include your
Bot token from your [application dashboard] inside the file and don't
share it with anyone!

Run the program, and then add the bot to your discord server and it will
play games with people via the `!tt` commands.
